OSSN Leadership Summit
----------------------

Mozilla hosts an annual event to train OSSN leaders. They pay for two people to
go to these summits. Mines ACM should send two people who haven't gone to the
summit before.

Network Calls
-------------

These calls occur once or twice every month. At least one officer should attend
the meetings.

Resources
---------

Mozilla provides a bunch of resources for helping run the club. These include:

- Experiments (opportunities for OSS contribution without necessarily coding)
- Open Source Guides
- A pizza fund

Communication
=============

:Owner: Sumner Evans

Communication is super important to the functioning of the club. There are three
main aspects of communication which this document will address: officer
communication, Mines ACM internal communication, and external communication.

Officer Communication
---------------------

:Owner: Sumner Evans

Normally, the officer team sees each other around campus a lot. Thus, in-person
communication is preferable when possible since in-person interaction has a lot
more communication bandwidth than text/email/literally anything else. When
appropriate, things discussed in person should be shared with the entire officer
team, and CPW and/or Tracy if applicable. Additionally, if appropriate,
important results of these discussions should be documented in this repository.

When communication needs to happen not in person, use Matrix or email. Matrix
will be the default for instantaneous communication with other officers. Email
will be the default for any communication that you want remembered for any
significant length of time.

Officer meetings will be held regularly, every other week. Be prepared to share
progress reports with the rest of the officers, as well as bring up any
questions that you may have.

You **do not** have to wait officer meeting to bring something up.

Mines ACM Internal Communication
--------------------------------

Another critical aspect of communication is communicating with the general ACM
members. The primary form of communication is the mailing list.

It is critical that an email is sent every Monday, before Tuesday's meeting
with information about the upcoming meeting and any other pertinent
announcements.

See the `mailing list archives`_ for past emails.

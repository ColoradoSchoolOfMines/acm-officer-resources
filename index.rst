Mines ACM Officer Resources
===========================

If all of the officers died in a car crash, would Mines ACM still continue to
operate? The goal of this repository is to make the answer to this question
"yes". In other words, this repository is designed to make the bus count for ACM
:math:`\infty`!

This repository is inspired by https://github.com/acmumn/officer-resources/

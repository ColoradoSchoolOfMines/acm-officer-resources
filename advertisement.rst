We need to advertise our club. There are three main sources of new members:
Celebration of Mines, CS classes, and referrals.

Celebration of Mines
--------------------

:Owner: Sumner Evans

TODO: figure out what needs to happen

CS Classes
----------

:Owner: Sumner Evans

The CS Department as a whole is very supportive of ACM. We should attempt to get
someone to present about ACM at every section of 101, 261, 262, and 306.
Advertising at the upper level classes is not nearly as useful since by then,
most people know about ACM anyway.

Referrals
---------

:Owner: Sumner Evans

We should encourage people to bring friends.

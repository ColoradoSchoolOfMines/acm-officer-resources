Use the ACM Website has a built-in survey system to create a survey before each
meeting. Data points that are useful to collect are:

- Is this your first time at ACM? If so, how did you hear about ACM?
- How did you find out about the event? (This is especially useful for tech
  talks.)

In addition to these, collect any other metrics you want. In general, make
everything except for name optional. We don't want people to skip filling out
the survey because they're overwhelmed by the number of fields that they have to
fill out.

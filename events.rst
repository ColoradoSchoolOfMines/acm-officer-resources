:Owner: Sumner Evans

We have four main types of events: weekly meetings, hackathons/competitions,
onboarding sessions, service events, and social events.

All Events
----------

These events have a lot in common as far as logistics go.

- **Room:** (Jackson) every event needs a room. Reserve through TODO.
- **Email Notifications:** (Sumner) every meeting needs an email notification.
  This should go out the day before the event.
- **CS Weekly Notification:** (Sumner) every meeting needs to be on the CS
  Weekly. Email Kelly Knechtel <knechtel@mines.edu> to get events on the weekly.
- **Flyers:** (Sumner) every meeting needs a flyer.

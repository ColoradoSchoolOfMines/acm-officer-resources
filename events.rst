Events
======

:Owner: Sumner Evans

We have four main types of events: weekly meetings, hackathons/competitions,
onboarding sessions, service events, and social events.

All Events
----------

These events have a lot in common as far as logistics go.

.. note::

    Not all events need require all of these. For example, social events don't
    need to be advertised in the CS Weekly.

- **Room:** (Sumner) every event needs a room. Reserve through TODO.
- **Email Notifications:** (Sumner) every meeting needs an email notification.
  This should go out the day before the event.
- **CS Weekly Notification:** (Sumner) every meeting needs to be on the CS
  Weekly. Email Kelly Knechtel <knechtel@mines.edu> to get events on the weekly.
- **Flyers:** (Sumner) every meeting needs a flyer.

TODO: describe more info specific to these:

- Weekly Meetings
- Hackathons/competitions

Social Events

:Owner: Sumner Evans

The goal of social events is to provide a catalyst for social integration into
our club.
